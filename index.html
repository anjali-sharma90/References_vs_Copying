      const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));
      console.log(dev2);

      //The code `const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));` creates a deep copy of the `wes` object. Here's what each part does:

      // 1. `JSON.stringify(wes)`: Converts the `wes` object into a JSON string. This step serializes the object and all its nested objects into a string representation.

      // 2. `JSON.parse(...)`: Parses the JSON string back into a JavaScript object. This step creates a new object that is a deep copy of the original object.

      // By combining these two steps, you effectively create a new object (`dev2`) that is a deep copy of the `wes` object. This means that `dev2` is a separate object in memory from `wes`, and modifying `dev2` will not affect `wes`, and vice versa.
